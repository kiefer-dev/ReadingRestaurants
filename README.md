# Reading Restaurants
A very simple web app created as a way for my friends and I to quickly navigate to the menus/hours of our favorite restaurants in the Reading, PA area.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I began this website back when I was first learning HTML, CSS, and how to implement JavaScript functionality. I wanted something simple and pleasing to look at that my friends & I could navigate to when we didn't know what we wanted to eat - it's easy to add more restaurants to the source code when we discover a new restaurant in the area. The website has search functionality and uses vanilla JS to achieve filtering, as well as to show what day of the week it is so it can be determined if the restaurant is open/closed.

## Optimizations
As of now, the restaurants/hours/menus need to be hard-coded in. I don't mind this because it's just meant as a tool for people I know to easily find our favorite places to eat. However, this early website of mine would serve as inspiration for my larger project "Let's Eat" that allows users to login and add restaurants themselves.
Originally I wanted functionality that would determine the current time and hide restaurants that hadn't opened yet / closed, but I decided to shift my focus to the more comprehensive Let's Eat project instead.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first "real" website design and I enjoyed figuring out how to integrate vanilla JavaScript with CSS styling that I implemented by scratch. Design isn't my strong-suit, and I'm eager to learn more about how to utilize React to build prettier websites.
